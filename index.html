        <p id="p1">My name is Jeff Ball, and I'm from Edmonds, Washington. I currently live and work in Seattle, and I am a marketing associate and media developer at a small company called Scisco Genetics, Inc. My work there has given me the opportunity to build a basic skillset as a front end web developer, and I am actively working to transition into a role as a full stack developer. This website is my web developer portfolio. From March to September 2019, I will be enrolled in a full stack web development course at the University of Washington, and I will be adding to my portfolio as the course progresses. Stay tuned for more content.</p>
